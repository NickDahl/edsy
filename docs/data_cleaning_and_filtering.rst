Data Cleaning and Filtering

Data Cleaning
==============

Data cleaning is the process of correcting or removing inaccurate records of a "raw data" so that, after the treatment, the transformed data will have the quality necessary for statistical analysis or be consistent with an existing database. More explicitly, the variable names, types, and values will be consistent and uniform.

In order to clean a dataset, first, we need to be able to detect the anomalies within the data. Types of anomalies include the values that are stored in the wrong format (ex: a number stored as a string), the values that fall outside of the expected range (ex: outliers), values with inconsistent patterns (ex: dates stored as mm/dd/year vs dd/mm/year), trailing spaces in strings (ex: "data" vs "data "), etc.

One method of detecting these anomalies is the summary statistics of the variables, which can be obtained by using :code:`summary()`. Here is an example using the hurricane data:


.. code-block:: rout

    > # Summary for a numerical variables
    > summary(hurricane$age)
     Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
    19.00   49.00   60.00   58.69   69.00  106.00      40


.. code-block:: rout

    > # Summary for a categorical variable
    > summary(factor(hurricane$prepared))
     1    2    3    4    5 NA's 
    92  322  428  130   17    7 


We also summarize all of the variables at once but first we have to set them to match their exact data types. If we run :code:`summary(hurricane)` right away then we'll get this unintended result:

Variables like :code:`worry`, :code:`prepared`, :code:`homeloc`, :code:`gender`, :code:`income`, :code:`politics` are supposed to be categorical and not numeric. We can easily convert them using :code:`mutate_at()` function from the :code:`dplyr` package (also :code:`tidyverse`)


.. code-block:: r

    # Converting data types
    library(dplyr)
    library(magrittr) # for %>%
    hurricane %>% mutate_at(c("worry", "prepared", "homeloc", "gender", "income", "politics"), as.factor)


.. code-block:: rout

    # â€¦ with 986 more rows


And now we can get the full summary statistics that we want:

As we can see, there might be some anomalies with variables:

* :code:`nstorm`: where the mean value is 2.5 but some response have the value of 20. Same for :code:`nevac`
* :code:`zone`: as most of the respondents are from Zone A. But this is basically related to the survey method which would later require that some weighting of the variables would be applied.


For :code:`nstorm` and :code:`nevac`, we can better investigate what's going on by actually visualizing them in a histogram using the :code:`hist()`.


.. code-block:: r

    hist(hurricane$nstorm, breaks=10, main="How many storms have you experienced?", xlab="Number of storms")
    hist(hurricane$nevac, breaks=10, main="How many storms have you evacuated?", xlab="Number of evacuations")
