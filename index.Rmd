# Prerequisites {-}

The following tutorials are written in R. To install R on your computer, please visit this link: https://www.r-project.org/
You should also install RStudio: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

We will use the packages in the **tidyverse** library:

```{r eval=F}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

We will use a sample datasets from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. The advantage of these data is that they were collected and processed by our colleagues. So we have a good documentation on the sampling methods and the data processing workflow applied to eah of the datasets.
