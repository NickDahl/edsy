Data Cleaning and Filtering

Data cleaning is the process of correcting or removing inaccurate records of a "raw data" so that, after the treatment, the transformed data will have the quality necessary for statistical analysis or be consistent with an existing database. More explicitly, the variable names, types, and values will be consistent and uniform.

In order to clean a dataset, first, we need to be able to detect the inaccuracies within the data
